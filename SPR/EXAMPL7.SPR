/* The cut */
/* The cut is a builtin that is a control structure */
/* It says roughly "stop looking for any more solutions of the
   rule head which I come from"

  Here is an example consider the following program:
*/

((north_american P)
 (lives_in P usa)
 (cut)  /* try "fail" here; try nothing here; use (trace) */
)
((north_american P)
 (lives_in P canada)
)

(lives_in anca usa)
(lives_in brian usa)
(lives_in murray canada)

/* If you ask the following question:
   
  (north_american Somebody)
 
 you get only one answer out of an expected 3!
 
 This is because once execution gets to the cut no more
 other solutions for the goal (north_american Somebody)
 are considered

 Turn on (trace) and try (fail) above, instead of (cut).
 Try to predict the answer with (fail) to test your 
 understanding of the two predicates.
 
 The cut is used in the definition of "not" which is in 
 sprolog.ini and it is used in the file help.spr

 If the value of Goal is a goal
 then (not Goal) succeeds if and only if Goal fails.

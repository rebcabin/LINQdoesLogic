You need to put the entire MATHPROG folder in a place where Mathematica can find it

a good place to put it in Windows is 

	%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Roaming\Mathematica\Applications

On the mac, in 

	~/Library/Mathematica/Applications

Put the entire MATHPROG folder in the Applications folder in either system. Then run the notebook LOGICEXAMPLES.nb.
